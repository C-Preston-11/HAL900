FPGA Useless Box 

A classic useless boxâ€”with an FPGA - Instead of an Arduino, this version uses Verilog HDL to generate a variable PWM signal (50 Hz) for servo control, powered by USB-C and housed in a sleek acrylic case to show off the guts.

âœ¨ Key Features

    FPGA-Powered: PWM logic written in Verilog HDL (no Arduino!).

    Precise Servo Control: 50 Hz PWM with adjustable duty cycle.

    Sleek Design: acrylic case (see-through for max fun).

    USB-C Power: Modern power delivery (no batteries needed).

    "Useless" But Educational: Great for learning FPGA timing control.
